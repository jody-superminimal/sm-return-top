Super simple wordpress plugin to add a return to top arrow.

Arrow appears after scrolling past 400px.

The arrow is an inline svg so all styles can easily be overriden in css.

To install into a WP site:
* cd into plugins dir
* git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/jody-superminimal/sm-return-top.git
* wp plugin activate sm-return-top
